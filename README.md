# UTILIZATION
You need to :
- Put your DISCORD TOKEN in lib/routes.js

Your MUSIC FOLDER may be built this way :
- music folder
  - PlaylistName
    - music
    - music
  - PlaylistName
    - music
    - music

It may not be the best music bot of all time and won't probably help you in any way.
If you require any information, I'll be glad to give you some.
