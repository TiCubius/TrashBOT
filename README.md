## DISCORD-BOT
Using [discordjs](https://github.com/hydrabolt/discord.js), I created a little bot for Discord.

Functions:
- /clear:chat -> Clear the current channel's chat.
- /get:achievements -> get a random achievement from cfg/achievements.json

It's not much, it's very bad and I'm not proud of it. So let's put it on github.
*(Also, my first try on NodeJS)...*
