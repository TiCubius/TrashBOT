## DISCORD-BOT
Using [discordjs](https://github.com/hydrabolt/discord.js), I created a little bot for Discord.

Functions:
- /clear:chat 			-> Clear the current channel's chat.
- /get:achievements 	-> get a random achievement from cfg/achievements.json
- /video:add [VIDEOURL] -> add a new video into the database
- /video:get [TITLE] 	-> get a video from the database, based on the title

It's not much, it's very bad and I'm not proud of it. So let's put it on github.
*(Also, my first try on NodeJS)...*
