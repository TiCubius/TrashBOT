## INFORMATIONS
This is my first NODEJS project.
It may be bad written and will most probably crash at some point.
**You most probably don't want to use it but you can still use parts of this though.**

### UTILIZATION
To use this, you need to put in the config/config.json file : 
- A discord account
- A MySQL/Maria database (table: youtube_video which contains id, title, username, url, created_at, created_by)
- An YouTube API key

### COMMANDS
- /video:get [[USERNAME]] TITLE
- /video:get TITLE
- /video:add url
- /chat:clear
- /clear:chat
